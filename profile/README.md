# How to Build (or Break) Trust:

**Approach with Caution:** Observe a creature’s behavior before deciding how to interact. Some may appreciate acts of kindness, while others respond better to displays of dominance.

**Gestures Matter:** Use gestures or movements that mimic their body language. For example, bowing slightly to Mr. Silver might indicate respect, earning his favor.

**Track Their Reactions:** If a creature becomes less aggressive after you perform a specific action, repeat it in future encounters.
